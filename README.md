# Tank-Sense-SIT210-Project
The project monitors the water level in a water tank and uses this information to control a water valve and also to display on a remote control unit the status of the water valve and the water level as a percent. The user selects either an AUTO mode or to manually control the water valve ON/OFF themselves.


The .ino, .h, .cpp files are for a Particle Argon with a Hc-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance sensor, Power Relay Module and a water solenoid.

The .py file was devloped on a rspberry pi 4 with the GUI displayed on a Waveshare 2.8inch LCD 320Ã—240 touchscreen.
